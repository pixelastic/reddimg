# Reddimg

I archived this repository because the experiment is over. I wanted to check if
I could make a website that auto-updates with data coming from reddit.

The answer is yes, using CircleCI and the reddit API. I ended up creating an npm
module named `reddinx` to ease the job of extracting and indexing data from
reddit, and moved the content of this website into dedicated websites.

So, I decided to archive this repository for anyone wanting to browse the code,
but I no longer want this website publicly available.
